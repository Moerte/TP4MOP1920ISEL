<p class="p1">Freedom to move</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The creatures can only move in a sliding movement. If a piece is surrounded to the point that it can no longer physically slide out of its position, it may not be moved.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The only exceptions are the Grasshopper, which can jump into or out of a space, and the Beetle, which can also climb up or down.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Similarly, no piece may move into a space that it can't physically slide into.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Note: When first introduced to the game, a piece may be placed into a space that is surrounded as long as it does not violate any of the placing rules, in particular, the rule about pieces not being allowed to touch pieces of the other color when they are first placed.</span></p>
