<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once in play, a Mosquito can take on the movement ability of any creature of either color that it is touching at the start of its move (a stack with a Beetle on top counting as a Beetle for this purpose), thus changing its movement characteristics throughout the game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Exceptions: If a Mosquito is only touching another Mosquito at the start of its move, it may not move at all. If a Mosquito is moved as a Beetle onto the top of the Hive, then it continues to move as a Beetle until it climbs down.</span></p>
