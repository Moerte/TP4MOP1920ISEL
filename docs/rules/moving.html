<p class="p1">Moving</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once your Queen Bee has been placed (but not before), you can decide whether to use each turn after that to place another tile or to move one of the pieces that have already been placed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Each creature has its own way of moving about the Hive and it's possible to move pieces to a position where they touch one or more of your opponent's tiles.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Note: All pieces must always touch at least one other piece. If a piece the only connection between two parts of the Hive, it may not be moved.</span></p>
